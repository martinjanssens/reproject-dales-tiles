# reproject-dales-tiles
Reading restart files generated by [DALES](https://github.com/dalesteam/dales) over multiple processors and reprojecting for restarts with different advection schemes or resolutions.
This is a very messy implementation intended for me, but I'd be happy to clean it up for or help along anyone interested in using it.
